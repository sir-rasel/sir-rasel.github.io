- **Contractors and Freelancers**: Flexible and variable earnings. Higher potential with specialization and niche expertise. Example: Toptal, Upwork engineers charging hourly/retainer fees.

## Cost Centers vs. Profit Centers
Where you sit inside a company affects growth opportunities.

### Cost Center
You support internal systems. Examples: Internal IT, shared infra teams in banks.
-   Promos may be slower
-   Less visibility
-   Stable workload

We should get an understanding about what type of company in general exists, what the roles are with their desired expectations, and some compensation info from our above discussion. Now let's discuss how we can prepare for promotions and perform accordingly.

## How Promotions Are Decided
Promotions depend on **sustained performance**, not one-time
achievements.

Companies typically evaluate:
