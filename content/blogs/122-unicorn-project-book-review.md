## Book Introduction

"**The Unicorn Project: A Novel about Developers, Digital Disruption, and Thriving in the Age of Data**" is a compelling follow-up to Gene Kim’s bestselling book, The Phoenix Project. While The Phoenix Project focused on IT operations and DevOps from an operations perspective, The Unicorn Project shifts the lens to software developers, architects, and the challenges they face in modern enterprises.

Set in the same universe as The Phoenix Project, the novel follows Maxine, a senior developer at a large enterprise, who finds herself burned out for a major failure and reassigned to a struggling project. As she navigates bureaucratic red tape, outdated processes, and cultural resistance, she joins a group of like-minded rebels determined to transform the company from within.

Through Maxine’s journey, The Unicorn Project introduces the Five Ideals - a set of guiding principles that drive high-performing software teams and digital transformations. The book explores critical themes such as developer productivity, psychological safety, and the power of data-driven decision-making.

## About Author(s)

**Gene Kim** is an experienced IT professional, researcher, and author known for his work in DevOps and IT operations. He’s multiple award-winning CTO and the creator of the DevOps Enterprise Summit and has co-authored several influential books, including The DevOps Handbook, The Phoenix Project.

## High Level Overview

The story follows Maxine, a highly skilled senior developer at a large automotive parts company called Parts Unlimited. After being unfairly blamed for a major IT failure, she is reassigned to work on a difficult and failing initiative known as The Unicorn Project. Maxine quickly discovers that the company’s software development process is broken - developers are bogged down by slow approvals, outdated technologies, long build times, and an environment resistant to change.

As she struggles with these challenges, Maxine meets a group of forward-thinking developers and engineers who are determined to fix the system from within. Together, they work to modernize software development, adopt DevOps principles, and enable a culture of innovation.

Through Maxine’s journey, The Unicorn Project highlights the everyday frustrations of software developers in traditional enterprises - long deployment cycles, lack of autonomy, and resistance to modern DevOps practices. The book demonstrates how organizations can overcome these challenges by embracing agile development, continuous delivery, and a culture of trust and experimentation.
