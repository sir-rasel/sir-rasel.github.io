## What are the Challenges of Presentation?
- **Fear of Public Speaking:** According to a study, the biggest fear in this world is public speaking. It is the biggest challenge for presenting something as well. To become a better presenter, first of all we need to overcome this.
- **Shyness:** Another challenge is shyness. Naturally most of us have a shyness in front of people. Which creates a problem and holds us tight in the discomfort area.
- **Fear of Being Uncomfortable:** Before presenting or public speaking, we think a lot about the situation and fear being uncomfortable.
- **Language Mismatch:** Sometimes, or most of the time, there is a possibility of a language mismatch between the audience and speaker. In this scenario, it creates an extra challenge for the presenter.

## Zone of Discomfort (ZoD)
**Zone of discomfort**, or **ZoD**, is the area where you face challenging and scary but interesting things. Unlike the comfort zone, it does not give you enough confidence but makes you strong. To be a pro presenter, you need to learn, handle, and keep yourself engaged in the ZoD as much as possible.

## Components of A Pro Presentation
- **Preparation:** Have enough preparation for the presentation.
- **Confidence:** Gather enough confidence by preparation.
- **Strong Opening and Closing:** Maintain a strong opening and closing in the presentation.
- **Effective Communication:** Effectively communicate with the audience anyhow.
- **Engagement:** Engaging the audience with the contents of the presentation or question answers.
- **Purposeful Storytelling:** Purposeful storytelling also creates purposeful engagement with the audience.
- **Authenticity:** The content of the presentation or story should be authentic enough.
- **Empathy:** Always focus on the audience and be empathetic to them.
- **Thoughtful:** Make the audience thoughtful by creating curiosity.
- **Time Management:** Always keep an eye on the time. Because it is very important to finish in time.
- **Adaptability:** Though enough preparation sometimes disturbs the audience, it can create challenging situations. Then they should be able to handle them and adapt to the situation.
- **Body Language:** The presenter should maintain good, nice, and confident body language while presenting.

## 4 Steps of Pro Presentation

### 1. Preparation:
- **Understanding the audience:** The most important and first thing of preparation is to research/understand your audience. Mostly focus on audience needs, desires, and problems.
- **Preparing Contents:** Making PPT can be visual, auditory, or kinesthetic. Contents should focus on how it helps the audience. how it solves audience problems/pain points. Slides should be engaging enough (see below for designing an effective, engaging presentation).
- **Practice:** After preparing the contents, now it's time to practice it before delivering it in front of an audience. You can rehearse by simulating a real environment, measuring timing, and improving by recording yourself and getting feedback from others. Also, another important thing is practicing Q&A.

### 2. Delivery:
- **Confidence:** Delivering the prepared and practiced contents confidently. Don't fear, and imagine success always. Deliver the memories' contents (see below for the tips of the memories' contents).
- **Flow:** Stay with your plan and keep/maintain the flow.
- **Engagement:** While delivering content, keep creating engagement gradually.

### 3. Feedback:
Take audience feedback. Sometimes audiences ask questions by themselves, sometimes not. You should ask why-type questions and brief them on how to address the audience. And moving forward to a strong conclusion gradually with them.

### 4. Delivery Again Based on Feedback:
**Rearrange** yourself in a short time. Accommodate and adapt the feedback from step 3. Restart from the point that you finished last time. Remember, adaptability is a key component of a pro presentation.
