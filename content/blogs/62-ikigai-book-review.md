Interestingly, most of the tips or information this book shared is the same as **already described in our religion, Islam**. In a nutshell I can say, if someone obeys and maintains our religion, Islam, in his/her life, then it is just a matter of time for him/her to be happy.

## Book introduction
In **Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life**, written by Héctor García and Francesc Miralles, readers are taken on a journey to uncover the timeless wisdom of ikigai, a Japanese philosophy that centers on finding one's purpose in life. Rooted in Japanese culture and particularly exemplified by the residents of Okinawa, the home to some of the longest-living people in the world. Ikigai is the idea that everyone has a unique reason for being, a driving force that fuels their happiness and fulfillment.

The authors blend insights from psychology, sociology, and traditional Japanese practices to offer a guide for discovering one's ikigai. Through vivid stories, research on longevity, and practical advice, the book reveals how this concept helps people lead meaningful lives, stay active well into old age, and maintain a positive outlook even in life's challenges.
