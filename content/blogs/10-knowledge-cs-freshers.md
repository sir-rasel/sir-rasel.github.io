University life is the prime time for grabbing knowledge and getting ready for industry. But there has been a misconception that anyone can only be industry-ready only when he/she starts working or has a job. This is not true at all. Undoubtedly, whoever is willing to prepare himself upfront should start at the university or at least immediately around graduation completion. 

I want to share the knowledge list, or things good to know, for a CS/CSE fresher. Please note, all the information is my personal opinion based on my experience and courses taken at university. So it can vary from other persons' opinions. 

If you're a CS (Computer Science) or CSE (Computer Science & Engineering) fresher, there’s a lot you can benefit from knowing early on. Here's a curated list of skills, tools, concepts, and habits that will give you a strong foundation and help you stand out.
