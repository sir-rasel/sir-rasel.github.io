## Story
Rakib is 6 years old and today he is very happy as it's his birthday. Rakib's parents arrange a party to celebrate his birthday for doubling his happiness. To make the program organized and successful, it's really need to follow some steps like below:

- Make the birthday cake
- Invite the guest
- Decorate the celebration room
- Cook food
- Welcome the guest
- Serve foods to guest etc.

So to make the program happens successfully, need to define, ordering the steps, and follow the steps accurately.

## Programming
In general cases, **programming** is a way to instruct someone/something to make a **program** done. *So now question is what is program?* A program is a set of instructions/steps or processes that makes a whole things done combinedly. For example, in the above story, the birthday celebration is a program and the operations are the instructions/steps that make the program successful combinedly.

And Comouter Programming is nothing but define some steps/instructions and tells the computer to follow the steps/instructions to do the program done. 

In layman terms: Programming is a way to "***instruct the computer to perform various tasks***".

## Programming Language
As computer can not understand the human language. So we need a language that can a computer really understand. This computer understandable language is known as ***programming language***. 

There are many programming language exist in the world. Some popular language are mentioned in the below picture.

In my opinion everybody should start learning programming with **C/C++**. Because these 2 language are consider as the mother of other programming language.

## What are fundamental concepts of programming?
Fundamental means ***"forming a necessary base or core"***. That is fundamental is the core and most important things of something. And fundamental concepts of programming refers to those concept that is the basement of every programming language. 

So a building without strong basement and knowledge of programming without clear understanding of fundamental concepts are both in danger.

We can identify the following concepts as the fundamental of programming:

1. **Data types, Variable, Constant:** Defines how the data shape, where and how it stores, and how use those values.
2. **Operator:** Defines the actions or operations which need to perform onto variables or data's.
3. **Condition:** Handles the conditional flow of program.
4. **Loop:** Performs a set of similar actions again and again.
5. **Function:** Used for maintaining code readability, reusability, modularity.
6. **Memory allocation and Pointer:** Defines how the computer allocate memory for variables and other parts of our program. And pointer helps us to work with memory directly.
7. **Variable lifetime and Scope:** Defines how much time and from which part a variable is accessible.
8. **Object oriented programming:** A programming paradigm that helps us to think and program like the real world objects.

Others advanced concept:
1. **Data structure:** Define how our data will be store and perform the operation effectively that define by it.
2. **Algorithm Design:** Teaches us how a problem need to solve step by step and efficiently based on some principle.
3. **Threads, Async-await, Concurrency, Parallel:** Helps us uses the multi processor to speed up our program execution.

In my opinion learning and understanding the fundamentals of anything is more important than just use it. If you can understand the basics then you can adopt any language quite fast because fundamentals are same for all language For example, if you can know what is a gun and how it works then it is very easy to shoot by it with any type of gun.
