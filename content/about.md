### Overview

I am a product-centric software engineer with several years of experience designing, implementing, and maintaining highly scalable and reliable systems that serve millions of users.

I always prioritize business needs before jumping into architecture or implementation. Coming from the "Competitive Programming" background, solving tough challenges - whether it’s a critical system bug or a complex requirement - comes naturally to me.

- Following architecture patterns that best align with business goals.
